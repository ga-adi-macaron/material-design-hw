## Intro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) website design.

1. Material design forces more visually complex pictures to stand out. This limits the ways that a picture can impact a layout's design. For example, setting a noisy picture as the background of a layout would interfere with the material components placed on top of it, causing them to look out of place.

2. A material object exists in three-dimensional space, but can only be visually complex in two dimensions. For most uses this is ideal, however, the inability to expand on the z-axis may create issues in the coming years as augmented and virtual realities become more commonplace in standard devices.

3. The guidelines imposed on material properties creates a link to the real world in a sense. For example, two objects in the real world cannot occupy the same space simultaneously, so by translation two material elements cannot pass through each other or be placed in the same area without having one at a higher elevation than the other.

4. Material design as a whole promotes minimalistic design standards. With a minimalistic approach to design, something as simple as changing a shade of blue to be darker or changing text color from black to dark grey can result in a noticeable difference.

5. The approach to creating icons is arguably the greatest asset that material design has to offer. When developers are left to come up with their own standards regarding icon design, a screen with a few icons can quickly become disastrous in appearance. While no two icons should look the same, two completely different material icons will at least look like they don't belong in different universes.

##### Write at least 3 reasons why the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) design follows Material Design guidelines. Be as specific as possible.

1. When opened, the side drawer menu temporarily floats above the rest of the UI while it is in use.

2. The toolbar at the top of the page appears on top of the content on each page and is consistent with content passing "underneath" it while scrolling.

3. All motion on the design specifications' pages snaps into place quickly and responsively. The search bar expands at a faster rate than the side menu, although it takes slightly longer due to the longer "distance" it must travel.
