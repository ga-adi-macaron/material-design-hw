##### Write at least 3 reasons why the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) design follows Material Design guidelines. Be as specific as possible.

1.it has distinct layers..the toolbar is above the whole page and when you open the menu on the left it lays above the page and the tool bar

2.it has good separation of sections using the accent color for the text and the small lines on the background making each section 

3.the text color and background makes it look more like pen on paper
