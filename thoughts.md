##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) website design.

1. Material design provides a unified guideline for all designer to follow which also makes all user experience to be unified.

2. Material design is very clean and seldom clutered with features.

3. It makes apps feel more alive by having animation between action. 

4. It makes the apps looks three-dimensional by casting shadows on top one another.

5. I also like the fact that it makes all these elements look and feel like paper.

6. All animation represent an action so the user would know what is happening visually. 

7.It can also be easy for programmer without design experience to make a beautiful looking app just by simply following the material design guidelines and specifications. 

8. One of the downsides I could think of is it might limit the potential a professional designer might offer. 

9. Another downside is that it might be difficult to enforce all the guidelines percisely on all apps.

10. Last major downfall is some user might misinterpret some of the guideline and makes it look different than it is on the guidelines.

##### Write at least 3 reasons why the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) design follows Material Design guidelines. Be as specific as possible.

1. One of the best example is the floating action button: it is a simple feature yet it is very clear to user what its function is.

2. Another is the layers and shadows that each element is casting. It shows how each individual object is unique to one another and not just one singular layout or element. 

3. Each animation represent an action. For example when pressing an item on a list, the selected item will popped up, and moving it up or down will be on top of other objects. During all that, the list shifts around. 

4. It provides a unified guidelines on the internet for all users to follow.
