## Intro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) website design.

1. I don’t like the amount of white space around all the text. While it might look better on a mobile device, I sort of doubt it because the image size was so huge.

2. I also don’t really like how when the drawer is clicked on the upper left side, the screen goes dim IMMEDIATELY and looks almost glitchy. I wonder if a slightly more gradual fade would work better. Still be super quick, but not instant.

3. The elevation of the toolbar is perfect. Even when there’s just text on the screen, the height of the toolbar really pulls the page together.

4. The motion of the search bar is very fluid and enjoyable. The drawer as well, they both feel really nice when they move.

5. I like the color schemes a lot. Especially the accent color matching the design as well, when you’re in different topics, the page you’re on in the drawer matches the color scheme of the page you’re on. It’s nice.

##### Write at least 3 reasons why the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) design follows Material Design guidelines. Be as specific as possible.

1. The shadows help raise elements off the base level. Things like the toolbar stay consistently at their intended elevation.

2. The movement of elements like the search bar and the drawer move realistically, and with meaning. 

3. The color scheme seems to have a light, a dark, and an accent color for each page. 

4. The toolbar starts extended, then shrinks as you start to scroll down. The extended toolbar has a different parent it follows than the toolbar itself, which is anchored to the top of the screen always.
