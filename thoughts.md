## Intro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) website design.

1. I applaud the effort and enterprise, but Material Design seems a bit self-boasting and not wholly necessary. 

2. I do like Google's encompassing belief that certain principles should be consistent across platforms and throughout usage. And embarking on creating that.

3. I very much appreciate the illusion of (just enough) depth being created on a nearly 2-dimensional surface. 

4. I do not like the idea that a pressed button becomes raised - as if connecting two magnets. My finger isn't a magnet. Although electromagnetism is a very real thing, gravity is the dominant force in our Universe, and on our planet. Things heavier than air go down.

5. I like its ideas and practices of duration, easing motion. It seems very fluid & natural.

6. Overall, I think Material Design is intuitive and very well thought out

4. Its palette and coloring is clean, solid, and works together harmoniously.
